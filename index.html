	<center><h1>About me</h1></center>
	<p>My name is Mario you guys may know my name from the game character Super Mario. My favorite sport right now is jiu jitsu, not only that this is a sport that I want to learn about. I also want to learn how it became to be and I would want to learn about all the sports in the world. When there is nothing to do at all in my house I go the gym to life weights or I play video games for the time being, until there is something to do. In general I have been an athlete my whole life which means I like to keep myself busy. Thats all for now thank you for reading my page and I hope this will motivate somebody in the near future.</p>
